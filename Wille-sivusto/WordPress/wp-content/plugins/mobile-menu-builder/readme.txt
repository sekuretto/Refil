<h3>WordPress Mobile Menu Builder: Better Mobile Navigation Experience</h3>

WordPress Mobile Menu Builder allows users to easily navigate your website without compromising the loading time. Up to four main menu options can be set to simplify the mobile navigation of this responsive menu. Compatibility is not an issue since this WordPress mobile menu is designed to fit perfectly to any mobile screen dimension. 

With this WordPress menu, you can work on a predesigned mobile menu theme and modify it according to your design preference. You can change the font, icon, and background styles and colors to perfectly match your website's brand. This is applicable to any WordPress theme. Thus, plugin compatibility issue is never a problem.

<h3>Specially designed for mobiles</h3>

WordPress Mobile Menu Builder is particularly designed to perfectly match the interface of any mobile phone. This provides a better user experience since it is exclusively designed for mobile. 

<h3>Ease of modification</h3>

Easily set the menu's texts and icons based on the menu options that you want to feature in your site. You can choose to highlight important portions of your blog such as Home, Blog, Contact details, and main website menu. With this responsive menu, you have the complete control to choose whatever you want to display as menus depending on your website's need.

<h3>Easily match the style of your website brand</h3>

Since you have the full control over the styling options, it will be easier for you to match the mobile menu design based on your website's brand and style. You can easily modify the menu bar's design to make it complementary to your website's design and layout.

<h3>Change menu bar placement</h3>

The menu bar's default position is at the bottom of the screen to make it easier for the user's thumb to reach the menu options. But you can also place the menu bar at the top position if you want to mimic the placement of menu in desktop view. 

<h3>On User Scroll Animation</h3>

You have the option to fix the menu bar or turn on the user scroll animation. Turning the user scroll animation on lets you hide and show the menu bar upon scrolling. This will help increase the screen space and maximize the user's mobile view. 

<h3>Show more navigation options through a Popup menu</h3>

The WordPress Mobile Menu Builder allows you to create an icon for pop-up contents where you can include more navigation options. You can integrate your existing widgets as selections to choose from. This WordPress menu is already widget-ready so can include as many as existing widgets as you like.

<h3>Fast and optimized mobile experience</h3>

WordPress mobile menu can be enabled without compromising your website's performance on mobile.
